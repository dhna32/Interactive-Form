# Interactive Form
 Project 3 - Team Treehouse Javascript FullStack

This project surely helped me yo have a more solid knowledge on using 
and manipulate the forms.

What I learned in this project:

 --> Learned how to set a default focus state in an input element
 --> Help me yo understand better the form attributes
 --> Learned how to select more concise elements 
     ex. const gold = document.querySelector('option[value="gold"]'); 

 --> Improved my knowledge on events and listeners how to select the
     proper values and how to use them as conditionals.
 --> Improved my knowledge in DOM Manipulation.

 In a brief,

 I think this project helped me to get more organized, breaking the 
 project into smaller pieces was a key factor on the developing of 
 this Project 3. I know there is a lot than can be improved in this 
 project maybe do more helper functions (on the design listener) and 
 the validations. I've tried for days this project and it finally works
 I would love to read your feedback. Thanks :)
